# Potato-Bot

Potato-Bot is a Discord bot that is currently in development. It is written in Python and uses the nextcord library.

## Setup

Unlike my previous bots, there is a setup process to it. Simply run `setup.py` and input all the required fields, and the bot will run automatically.

Once thats done you can run the bot with `python3 main.py`
